                    <p>Hello! My name’s Jonathon Knauff and I’m an aspiring UX/UI Designer from Denver, CO. I take inspiration from modern and futuristic technology while trying to keep things neat and minimalistic in my designs. <br> <br>Before my UX/UI design journey, I worked as a server/bartender for 10 years where I learned a lot of the people skills I have today, It was a fantastic outlet for me to be social and meet a lot of cool people! <br> <br>Outside my professional life I enjoy quality time with my family and my fat cat, Pepper. I love getting immersed in new and retro video games, especially the kind that give me a real challenge. I love staying up to date with news on the latest and greatest tech and tinkering with and fixing old and broken hardware. One of the best feelings in life is bringing life back into something that someone threw away thinking it was broken.</p>
